# login-form-ursina
A small and simple login form made in the Ursina Engine. 
Its just Text and some Buttons but you can edit this code so that it works the best for you.

Just download the png and the main.py and put them in the same folder. It should also work without a png. But i cant gurantee it.
To run the file just go into main.py and run it like you normally do it with your IDE or Command Line.

Version 1.1
Removed bg.jpg
Removed Background class from main.py
Added gray colored Background
